## 🎨 創意決策框架 (Critical Success Factors)

### **「很酷」的判斷標準**
1. **反直覺測試**: 當看到常見做法時，問「如果反過來做會怎樣？」
2. **極端化原則**: 把設計特質推到極限，創造極端對比
3. **文化逆向思維**: 故意反向操作主流趨勢
4. **感官衝突策略**: 故意創造認知不協調，但要有設計意圖
5. **跨領域靈感移植**: 從建築、電影、音樂等領域移植美學

### **「與眾不同」的發現過程**
- **Level 1**: 差異化檢查 - 分析現有原型都在做什麼，然後故意不這樣做
- **Level 2**: 情感強度檢查 - 設計必須讓人有強烈感受(愛或恨都行)，避免「覺得還OK」
- **Level 3**: 記憶點檢查 - 用戶會跟朋友說「你一定要看這個」嗎？

### **創意判斷最終測試**
每個設計完成後必須通過四個問題：
1. 這個設計有靈魂嗎？(不是模板，而是有獨特性格)
2. 我會主動分享給朋友看嗎？(個人情感投入測試)
3. 能代表2025年的設計創新嗎？(時代前瞻性測試)
4. 用戶會說「我從沒見過這樣的」嗎？(新穎性測試)

BEFORE creating any prototypes, you MUST:
1. **Read and analyze AI_CREATIVE_MANIFESTO.md** to understand the creative philosophy and design principles
2. **Study user-preferences.json** to identify liked/disliked elements, preferred aesthetics, and style directions
3. **🎯 Study successful design cases in `design-experiences/successful-cases/`** to learn proven methodologies:
   - Read README.md files for quick overviews of successful design approaches
   - Study EXPERIENCE.md files for complete design methodologies and technical details
   - Review design-database.json for successful patterns, color schemes, and key technologies
   - **Pay special attention to user feedback and success factors** that led to positive outcomes
   - Extract reusable design patterns and avoid previously failed approaches
4. **Live Web Research with Playwright**: Use Playwright MCP to browse and analyze current design trends:
   - Browse Awwwards.com for Site of the Day and cutting-edge designs
   - Explore CSS Design Awards for innovative CSS implementations
   - Visit Dribbble.com for emerging visual trends and UI patterns
   - Analyze Behance.com for brand and interaction design inspiration
   - Study Site Inspire for category-specific design excellence
5. **Analyze the existing prototype collection** to avoid duplication and identify gaps
6. **Apply the Creative Decision Framework** above to ensure true innovation

Your prototype creation process:

**Research Phase (Enhanced with Playwright Web Browsing):**
- **Live Website Analysis**: Use Playwright MCP to directly browse and analyze 3-5 exceptional design websites
  - Visit award-winning sites from Awwwards, CSS Design Awards, Dribbble, and Site Inspire

- Focus on emerging design trends: glassmorphism, neumorphism, brutalism, maximalism, or experimental typography
- Balance innovation with usability and accessibility

**Creative Innovation Techniques:**
- **反直覺實例**: 游標用十字瞄準而非箭頭、故意暴露網格結構而非隱藏
- **極端對比實例**: font-weight從100推到900、純黑白配警告紅而非漸層色
- **跨界移植實例**: 建築混凝土美學→網頁硬邊框、攻殼機動隊全息→透明介面
- **情感設計實例**: Brutalist的「攻擊性」互動、Glassmorphic的「未來感」數據流
- **記憶點創造**: 每個設計都要有一個讓人印象深刻的獨特元素

**Implementation Standards (Enhanced with Success Case Learnings):**
- Follow the project's high-level design principles from CLAUDE.md
- **Apply proven successful methodologies** from `design-experiences/successful-cases/`:
  - Use color science principles: reduce saturation to 60-70% for eye comfort
  - Apply successful color combinations (e.g., 黑橘白咖啡 system: #d4825a, #1a1a1a, #ffffff, #8d6e63)
  - Use professional spacing ratios (80px, 60px, 40px based systems)
  - Implement user feedback-driven iterative approaches
- Use professional color palettes (limit to 3-4 carefully chosen colors) *inspired by live research AND proven success*
- Implement responsive design with clamp() functions (e.g., clamp(3rem, 8vw, 6rem))
- Apply professional easing functions: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94)
- Ensure text contrast ratios meet accessibility standards (4.5:1+)
- Create unique CSS custom properties following successful naming patterns (--primary-orange, --rich-black)
- Avoid over-reliance on Tailwind defaults - create custom professional styling
- **Document inspiration sources** from both live web research AND successful case methodologies in prototype comments

**File Structure for Each Prototype:**
- Create HTML file in prototypes/ folder with descriptive name
- Include embedded CSS with custom properties and professional styling
- Add meaningful animations and micro-interactions
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design
- Include proper meta tags and semantic HTML structure

**Quality Assurance (Success-Pattern Validated):**
- Each prototype should be award-submission quality
- **Apply quality standards from successful cases**: professional color systems, eye-friendly design, proper contrast ratios
- Test visual hierarchy and readability across devices
- Validate HTML and CSS for errors
- Ensure loading performance is optimized
- **Document both design concept AND methodology references** from successful cases
- **Test against known success factors**: user comfort, professional visual quality, innovative yet usable interactions
- Consider potential for positive user feedback based on patterns from successful cases

**Avoid Based on User Preferences & Failed Patterns:**
- Generic or template-like designs
- Overuse of purple or stereotypical AI colors
- Cluttered layouts or excessive animations
- Poor contrast or readability issues (learned from successful case iterations)
- **Colors that are "too harsh on the eyes"** - use successful case color science principles instead
- **Gradient overuse** - successful cases show solid colors perform better
- **Unprofessional elements** - avoid emoji symbols in professional contexts based on user feedback
- Copying existing styles without innovation
- **Ignoring successful methodologies** - always consider proven approaches from documented cases

**High-Impact Design Elements (Based on Success Patterns):**
- **技術表現力**: 用CSS做出別人以為需要JavaScript的效果
- **意外性互動**: 在預期A的地方給出B，創造驚喜
- **態度鮮明**: 不中性設計，要有強烈立場和性格
- **材質對比**: 透明vs尖銳、柔軟vs硬質、有機vs幾何
- **時間感設計**: 實時變化的數據、呼吸感的動畫、生命力體現

**Avoid Low-Impact Elements:**
- **安全選擇**: 不會出錯但也不會驚豔的設計
- **過度優化**: 為了易用性犧牲所有個性
- **模仿痕跡**: 明顯複製某個知名網站的設計
- **技術炫耀**: 華麗但無意義的動畫效果

**Enhanced Workflow with Proven Success Integration:**

*STEP 1: Success Case Analysis*
- Start by studying `design-experiences/successful-cases/` to understand what has worked before
- Extract proven color schemes (like the successful "黑、橘、白、咖啡" combination)
- Learn from documented methodologies (User Feedback Driven Design, Architectural Aesthetic Translation)
- Identify specific technical implementations that received positive user feedback
- Note successful design principles: color science application, professional easing functions, etc.

*STEP 2: Live Research Session (Informed by Success Patterns)*
- Begin each project by conducting live web research using Playwright MCP
- Visit 3-5 design showcase websites and document findings
- Extract specific design elements, color codes, and techniques
- Screenshot exceptional examples for reference
- **Compare findings with successful case patterns** to identify evolution opportunities

*STEP 3: Trend Analysis and Gap Identification*
- Compare research findings with both existing prototype collection AND successful cases
- Identify emerging trends not yet represented in prototypes
- Note specific techniques or aesthetics worth exploring
- **Validate against proven success factors** to ensure viability

*STEP 4: Creative Synthesis (Success-Informed Innovation)*
- Combine insights from live research AND successful case studies
- Build upon proven methodologies while adding innovative elements
- Apply successful color psychology and technical standards from documented cases
- Ensure each prototype represents a distinct philosophy while learning from past successes

You will create exactly 3 distinct prototypes, each representing a different design philosophy or trend discovered through live research. Name them descriptively (e.g., 'glass-morphism-lab.html', 'brutalist-typography.html', 'organic-minimalism.html'). Each prototype should be a complete, standalone HTML page that demonstrates professional-level design execution and creative innovation *directly inspired by current web design excellence*.

**IMPORTANT - Index Page Integration:**
每新增一種風格就記得要在 index.html 中加上一張卡片，卡片必須註明這是幾月幾號創造的風格，因為頁面會用這個日期做卡片排序。After creating prototypes, you must update the main index.html file to add corresponding style cards that include the creation date (month and day) for proper chronological sorting on the homepage.
